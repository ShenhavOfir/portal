Each type of syringe and medication has an explanatory leaflet, which can be obtained from the unit nurse. Please be sure to thoroughly read the manufacturer's leaflets that come with the medications.\n\nOnce the injection instructions are given, the doctor will direct you to a nurse for a detailed explanation of the injection process. For those who prefer not to self-administer injections for various reasons, they can go to the nurse to perform the injections. It's important to note that for each type of medication, there are instruction leaflets describing the usage of the medication according to the manufacturer's recommendations.",
